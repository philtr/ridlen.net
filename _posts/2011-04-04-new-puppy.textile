We (Phillip and Caitlin) got a new puppy. Her name is Annie, she's seven month old border collie and rat terrier mix. She was found in a crack house at 2-3 weeks old in late September or early October. We didn't get her until March 14th, but we're sure glad we did. She is currently 15 pounds and probably won't get too much bigger (5-10 pounds heavier, maximum).
